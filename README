A simple perl script to output an ical file made with the intention of being imported into google calendar to display week numbers.

useage

GCWN [year] [month] [date] [no of weeks] [starting week number]

Required
Year: a value between 2000 and 2020
Month: a value between 1-12
Date: a value valid for the corrisponding month

Optional
No of weeks: the number of weeks you wish to generate numbers for
Starting Week Number: The week number you wish to start the cycle on.


Notes: 
-there is no provison for a 53 week year
-my recomendation is you put this in a seperate calender since the events are not linked in anyway each even would need to be deleted manualy in the event of a mistake. if the entire list is in a dedicated calendar it is easy to just delete the calendar.
